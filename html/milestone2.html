                        <p>09/10-09/15: I did a TypeScript tutorial from CodeAcademy. The link to the tutorial is 
                            <a class= "links" href= "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-typescript">here.</a>  
                            I learned the basics of functions, variables, objects, "arrays", types, union types, and type narrowing.  This tutorial took much longer than I anticipated, but it was good because I felt like I learned alot about different features of typescript, including how functions can be called in different ways.  The proof of completion can be found below:

                        <p>09/14-09/16: I did a React tutorial from CodeAcademy. The link to the tutorial is 
                            <a class= "links" href= "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101">here.</a>  
                            This was done in javascript and not typescript, so I was also given the opportunity to learn more javascript skills. I learned about components, state, hooks, about children and parents, and some styling.  This tutorial also took much longer than I anticipated, but I learned much more than I anticipated.  I still feel like I could perhaps go back to review some of the topics I am weak on, such as the state and stateless components interacting.  The proof of completion can be found below:

                        <p>09/16: I started to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game from scratch.  I am not using any references unless it is to look up a specific functionality.  I had the idea of using buttons as the spaces on the board, and to use those to change the notice of who's turn it is, as well as to change the text on the button, but was having much trouble.  I only started on Thursday after I did many tutorials earlier in the week, so I hope to have a functioning product soon.
