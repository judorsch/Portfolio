            Tic-Tac-Toe Progress Report: 
        </h2>
        <div class="docText"> I received feedback that the problem from last week was the formatting of the parameters
            of the function.  After this was fixed, it was easy to get the functionality of switching the turn working.
            I then also used the same function to set the symbol on each square.  I used hooks to accomplish both of these
            things.  I also added some CSS formatting to make the game look better.  I also implemented the function that 
            would calculate if there is a winner.  After I did this though, marking more squares was possible.  
            I tried to prevent this by using a varibale to denote the end of the game, but the page kept getting stuck
            in an infinite loop.  I discovered this was because I was using a normal variable and not a hook to keep track
            of this.  After I used a hook, the issue was solved.  I also added a button to start over.

            Calculator Progress Report: 
        </h2>
        <div class="docText"> I used hooks to help pass values of numbers and operations throughout my program.  
            I had the most difficulty with accounting for invalid input.  I had to make sure that each input from 
            the user was valid.  For numbers I accomplished this by using the parseFloat function, which takes a string 
            and returns either a number or NaN.  I would then test to see if the result was NaN or not.  For determining
            if the operation was valid, I tested to see if the input was an element of a list of operations I had.  
            In addition to testing if types were valid, I also had to test if the proposed operation would produce a number.
            Therefore, for division, exponentiation, and modulus, I had to test if the output was indeed a number before
            changing the answer.  I also tried something to see if it worked and it does.  I learned that you can pass an id
            to a react componenent, and then assign that id to the html tag that is being returned.  That way, you can have
            the same components that offer the same functionality, but they can be styled differently.  I did this with the entry
            places for the numbers and the entry place for the operation.  For both the calculator and tic-tac-toe, I did
            not follow a specific tutorial.  I did use W3Schools as a reference for determing which html tags had which 
            attributes, and Dr. Bart's video for help with functionality.

            TA Trainer: 
        </h2>
        <div class="docText"> I originally planned on doing another tutorial so I could get more comfortable with react, 
            but when Dr. Bart released his TA Trainer video, I decided that the video would be more valuable to me, as 
            if I learn React from Dr. Bart's perspective, it would be easier for me to follow along in class in the future.
            Not only did I watch the video, I created my own react app to duplicate his work.  I put it on GitHub and
            my multiple commits over the course of many hours can be observed.  I adapted some of the techniques he used to 
            accomplish the functionality of my other applications, including getting input from the user, which was something I had
            trouble with before watching.

            Deploying React App Progress Report: 
        </h2>
        <div class="docText"> Last week, I could not get my tic-tac-toe app to deploy.  I really messed up the 
            repository and ended up pushing one repository into another.  I went to office hours with a TA on Wednesday, and we tried to get it 
            working with the TA-Trainer I was working on, but it would not work.  Later in the day, it started working, for 
            reasons unknown with a generic new applicaiton.  However, it would not work with my previous tic-tac-toe project
            and the original TA-Trainer that was not yet complete, so I made new apps called tictactoe2 and tatrainer2 
            to get the pages working.  That is why the initial commit is much larger.  I am now confident tha I can deploy 
            react apps to github pages. I also learned how to change the icons and title on the tab.
