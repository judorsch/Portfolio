                        <p>09/10-09/15: I did a TypeScript tutorial from CodeAcademy. The link to the tutorial is 
                            <a class= "links" href= "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-typescript">here.</a>  
                            I learned the basics of functions, variables, objects, "arrays", types, union types, and type narrowing.  This tutorial took much longer than I anticipated, but it was good because I felt like I learned alot about different features of typescript, including how functions can be called in different ways.  The proof of completion can be found below:

                        <p>09/14-09/16: I did a React tutorial from CodeAcademy. The link to the tutorial is 
                            <a class= "links" href= "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101">here.</a>  
                            This was done in javascript and not typescript, so I was also given the opportunity to learn more javascript skills. I learned about components, state, hooks, about children and parents, and some styling.  This tutorial also took much longer than I anticipated, but I learned much more than I anticipated.  I still feel like I could perhaps go back to review some of the topics I am weak on, such as the state and stateless components interacting.  The proof of completion can be found below:
