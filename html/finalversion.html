                        <p> I spent the past week creating a web application that will display a line graph and certain statistics on different
                            stocks when different buttons are clicked.  I tried originally to do a get request, but because I was getting the 
                            information not from an API, I would have had to set up something called a proxy server, and Dr. Bart told me it
                            was not worth the time.  Instead, I was able to create a modal where the user could input the type of stock, along with 
                            ticker symbol, according to what it is classified when visitng wsj.com, and be able to download 1 year's worth of stock
                            information.  I used bootstrap to design the application,
                            and used interfaces to make function definitons cleaner.  I thought that I was using branches to work on some parts of my
                             code, but it seems that when I merged, they did not persist.  The link to the website is
